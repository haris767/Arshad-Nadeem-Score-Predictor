# Arshad-Nadeem-Score-Predictor
Arshad Nadeem Score Predictor By SVM and Linear Reggression
Overview
The Score Predictor project leverages machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Regression, to predict scores based on input features. This tool can be used for various applications, such as academic performance prediction or sports score forecasting.

Features
Implements both SVM and Linear Regression models for score prediction.
Visualizes the prediction results.
User-friendly command-line interface for input.
Performance metrics to evaluate model accuracy.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Required libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
(Include any other libraries your project depends on)
Installation
Clone the repository:
https://github.com/haris767/Arshad-Nadeem-Score-Predictor.git

Usage
Prepare your dataset in a CSV format with the relevant features and target score.

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py --model [svm|linear]
Replace [svm|linear] with your choice of model.
Follow the prompts to input the feature values for prediction.

Example
Provide an example of how to use the tool:

Input: Features like study hours, attendance, etc.
Output: Predicted score based on the selected model.
Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared score. Check the console output for model performance after running predictions.
